Evaluation servers (WebSocket)

In `./evaluation/supervised/` are evaluation implemtations based on supervised learning models. `./evaluation/unsupervised/` includes evaluation approaches based on unsupervised learning methods, such as feature extraction (which can in fact be based on supervised models) and dimensionality reduction. `./evaluation/semi-supervised/` might contain semi-supervised approaches for discovering measurement (/ behaviour) spaces, such as QDHF, ADAIF or AURORA.

`./measurements/diversity/` contains modules with different implementations of diversity measurements (like dimensionality reduction) and `./measurements/quality/` contains modules implementing various fitness / objective measures.
